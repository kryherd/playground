# HW 4.5

1) Finding readout time.

First, I converted the DICOMs to NIFTI.

`dcm2nii_afni ./dti_AP`  
`dcm2nii_afni ./dti_PA`

Then I opened the files to look at them.

- dti_AP
	- 40 slices I -> S
	- 128 slices R -> L
	- 128 slices P -> A 

- dti_PA
	- 40 slices I -> S
	- 128 slices R -> L
	- 128 slices P -> A

I also used `dicom_hdr` to look at some of the dicom header files. This gives some of the following information:

* `0018 1312        4 [1866    ] //   ACQ Phase Encoding Direction//COL `
* `0028 0011        2 [2762    ] //                    IMG Columns// 128`

That, combined with looking at the images, suggests that there are 128 phase lines.

Finding `BandwidthPerPixelPhaseEncode` seems to be a little harder. I tried looking at `(0019,1028)`, but it just says `Unimplemented`. I also tried looking at the ASCII header using code from [this post](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=fsl;92bd6f89.1403).

`strings NAMEOFDICOM | grep -C3 "BandwidthPerPixelPhaseEncode"`

This gives output like this:

```
# for ./dti_AP/S8519JRK_1_8_00016_00617_104523850000_104527190000_3539033377.dcm

257.00000000
BandwidthPerPixelPhaseEncode
a[0]
24.69100000
FMRIStimulLevel
```

The original code from that post uses the option `-A1`, implying that the `BandwidthPerPixelPhaseEncode` is in the line above the string. But that value changes based on which DICOM I am looking at.

```
# for ./dti_AP/S8519JRK_1_8_00004_00154_104422355000_104427198000_3686922264.dcm
