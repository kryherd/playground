Experiment 2:

The Dice coefficient has gone down to 0.0740741. 
This is even worse overlap than we saw in Experiment 1.
Because we removed motion censoring and putting motion coefficients into the regression,
motion is less accounted for. Thus, the same voxel in space may correspond to different brain regions.
This could help explain why the overlap is less than it was in Experiment 1. 

Comparing Exp 1 to Exp 2 using REML files:

In the Exp 2 data, all the significant activation is basically gone.
